ðŸ“„ Heart Disease Prediction Report

Introduction
This project explores the prediction of heart disease presence in patients using machine learning models. Early detection of cardiovascular issues is crucial, and machine learning can help identify high-risk patients effectively.

Methodology

Data Preparation:

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle categorical and numerical features.
Train-test split was performed to evaluate model performance fairly.
Models Used:

Logistic Regression: A linear model commonly applied to classification problems.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method based on decision trees, providing robustness and improved accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy was the primary metric for comparison.
Results

Logistic Regression Accuracy: 81.6%
Random Forest Accuracy: 97.1%
The Random Forest model achieved significantly higher accuracy, suggesting it is more effective in capturing complex relationships in the dataset.

Conclusion
Both models performed reasonably well, but the Random Forest classifier outperformed Logistic Regression by over 15 percentage points in accuracy. This demonstrates the strength of ensemble methods for structured medical datasets.

Best Model: âœ… Random Forest

Future Work
Conduct hyperparameter tuning for further improvement.
Explore additional evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) for a balanced assessment.
Deploy the best model into a user-friendly web application for real-time prediction.
